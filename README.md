Mix of practicing FlexBox and just generally messing around. Enjoy pictures and bios of pigeons from the Great Lakes Pigeon Rescue

I'm loosely following The Odin Project curriculum, this is my variation of the "Landing Page" project. I'll be making pages for my fictional website Pigeon Corp, just a website educating people on why they should have a per pigeon, as well as advertising a few available at the Great Lakes Pigeon Rescue. Enjoy!
